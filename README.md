# ML_Project_Victory_Predictor

**Machine Learning Project:  Victory Predictor for League of Legends || Python, Power BI and Streamlit**

In this project, I have created a machine learning model to predict victories in an online pc videogame called League of Legends. The user can use it after 10 minutes of game inputting some parameters that the have access to an predict the victory of their current game. 

**Overview**

**User Experience:**

To use the predictor, follow these simple steps:

1.Fill in the gaps in the General Information section

2.Fill in the gaps in the Requested Parameters section

3.Click in Predict my Victory.

**Code Snippet**

Below is a snippet of the libraries used in the development of the code, along with brief explanations of why each library was included:

pandas:Used for data manipulation and analysis, ensuring efficient handling of the dataset.
matplotlib and seaborn: Employed for data visualization, aiding in the analysis and interpretation of correlations crucial to understanding the impact of variables.

RandomForestClassifier: it is the machine learning model that we have selected after checking the performance of some other models.
Streamlit:Employs streamlit for creating interactive web applications with simple Python scripts, enhancing the overall user experience.
